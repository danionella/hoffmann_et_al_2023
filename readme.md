# Blazed oblique plane microscopy reveals scale-invariant inference of brain-wide population activity


The `notebooks` folder contains 3 jupyter notebooks that generate the main figures in the paper from the cell coordinates and delta F/F traces. 

All notebooks contain code that sets up a suitable environment in google collab and were tested with a google collab pro high memory instance. 

The high memory instance is only necessary to compute the pairwise correlations in `Figure_2.ipynb`, otherwise a free regulare instance is enough to perform the analysis.
